# Principal-Components-Analysis-of-Peripheral-Blood-Mononuclear-Cells
A dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) was analyzed using clustering and non-parametric methods like PCA.
The dataset can be found from 10X Genomics. There are 2,700 single cells that were sequenced on the *Illumina NextSeq 500*.

In this project, PCA was preformed, the ideal number of Principal Components was determined, scree plots were constructed, and pairwise plots were made.
